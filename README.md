A simple password generator using HTML, CSS and TypeScript. This was created to generate a random password from a requested length of characters.

## Aug 2

* Updated to remove JQuery, migrated app to TypeScript

## May 28

* Added name spacing to further organize app and methods.
* Also updated styling on password option toggles (added slight drop and inner shadows).

## May 26

* My password generator only allows > 12 now. For your own good :)
* Reset button removed, it was redundant after I changed to checkboxes
* Still seeing a weird border radius issue on Firefox - will research

## May 25

* Changed look slightly. 
* Used before and after elements to create slide buttons instead of radio buttons.

Added ability to select whether or not to use upper case characters, numbers or special characters into the generated password.
