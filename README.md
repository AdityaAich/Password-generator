## May 28

* Added name spacing to further organize app and methods.
* Also updated styling on password option toggles (added slight drop and inner shadows).

## May 26

* My password generator only allows > 12 now. For your own good :)
* Reset button removed, it was redundant after I changed to checkboxes
* Still seeing a weird border radius issue on Firefox - will research

## May 25

* Changed look slightly. 
* Used before and after elements to create slide buttons instead of radio buttons.
* Deleted second window - all items now reside in one window.

Added ability to select whether or not to use upper case characters, numbers or special characters into the generated password.
